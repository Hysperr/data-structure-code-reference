/**
PROVIDES: A template class for a node in a binary tree and functions for
manipulating binary trees. The template parameter is the type of data in
each node.

TYPEDEF for the binary_tree_node<Item> template class:
Each node of the tree contains a piece of data and pointers to its
children. The type of the data (binary_tree_node<Item>::value_type) is
the Item type from the template parameter. The type may be any of the C++
built-in types (int, char, etc.), or a class with a default constructor,
and an assignment operator.

CONSTRUCTOR for the binary_tree_node<Item> class:
binary_tree_node(
const item& init_data = Item( ),
binary_tree_node<Item>* init_left = NULL,
binary_tree_node<Item>* init_right = NULL
)
Postcondition: The new node has its data equal to init_data,
and it's child pointers equal to init_left and init_right.

MEMBER FUNCTIONS for the binary_tree_node<Item> class:
const item& data( ) const      <----- const version
and
Item& data( )                  <----- non-const version
Postcondition: The return value is a reference to the data from
this binary_tree_node.

const binary_tree_node* left( ) const  <----- const version
and
binary_tree_node* left( )              <----- non-const version
and
const binary_tree_node* right( ) const <----- const version
and
binary_tree_node* right( )             <----- non-const version
Postcondition: The return value is a pointer to the left or right child
(which will be NULL if there is no child).

void set_data(const Item& new_data)
Postcondition: The binary_tree_node now contains the specified new data.

void set_left(binary_tree_node* new_link)
and
void set_right(binary_tree_node* new_link)
Postcondition: The binary_tree_node now contains the specified new link
to a child.

bool is_leaf( )
Postcondition: The return value is true if the node is a leaf;
otherwise the return value is false.

NON-MEMBER FUNCTIONS to maniplulate binary tree nodes:
tempate <class Process, class BTNode>
void inorder(Process f, BTNode* node_ptr)
Precondition: node_ptr is a pointer to a node in a binary tree (or
node_ptr may be NULL to indicate the empty tree).
Postcondition: If node_ptr is non-NULL, then the function f has been
applied to the contents of *node_ptr and all of its descendants, using
an in-order traversal.
Note: BTNode may be a binary_tree_node or a const binary tree node.
Process is the type of a function f that may be called with a single
Item argument (using the Item type from the node).

tempate <class Process, class BTNode>
void postorder(Process f, BTNode* node_ptr)
Same as the in-order function, except with a post-order traversal.

tempate <class Process, class BTNode>
void preorder(Process f, BTNode* node_ptr)
Same as the in-order function, except with a pre-order traversal.

template <class Item, class SizeType>
void print(const binary_tree_node<Item>* node_ptr, SizeType depth)
Precondition: node_ptr is a pointer to a node in a binary tree (or
node_ptr may be NULL to indicate the empty tree). If the pointer is
not NULL, then depth is the depth of the node pointed to by node_ptr.
Postcondition: If node_ptr is non-NULL, then the contents of *node_ptr
and all its descendants have been written to cout with the << operator,
using a backward in-order traversal. Each node is indented four times
its depth.

template <class Item>
void tree_clear(binary_tree_node<Item>*& root_ptr)
Precondition: root_ptr is the root pointer of a binary tree (which may
be NULL for the empty tree).
Postcondition: All nodes at the root or below have been returned to the
heap, and root_ptr has been set to NULL.

template <class Item>
binary_tree_node<Item>* tree_copy(const binary_tree_node<Item>* root_ptr)
Precondition: root_ptr is the root pointer of a binary tree (which may
be NULL for the empty tree).
Postcondition: A copy of the binary tree has been made, and the return
value is a pointer to the root of this copy.

template <class Item>
size_t tree_size(const binary_tree_node<Item>* node_ptr)
Precondition: node_ptr is a pointer to a node in a binary tree (or
node_ptr may be NULL to indicate the empty tree).
Postcondition: The return value is the number of nodes in the tree.
