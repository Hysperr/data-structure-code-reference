/** FILE: node.h
 PROVIDES: A class for a node in a linked list, and list manipulation
 functions, all within the namespace main_savitch_5

 TYPEDEF for the node class:
     Each node of the list contains a piece of data and a pointer to the
     next node. The type of the data is defined as node::value_type in a
     typedef statement. The value_type may be any
     of the built-in C++ classes (int, char, ...) or a class with a copy
     constructor, an assignment operator, and a test for equality (x == y).

 CONSTRUCTOR for the node class:
   node(
     const value_type& init_data = value_type(),
     node* init_link = nullptr
   )
     Postcondition: The node contains the specified data and link.
     NOTE: The default value for the init_data is obtained from the default
     constructor of the value_type. In the ANSI/ISO standard, this notation
     is also allowed for the built-in types, providing a default value of
     zero. The init_link has a default value of nullptr.

 NOTE:
   Some of the functions have a return value which is a pointer to a node.
   Each of these  functions comes in two versions: a non-const version (where
   the return value is node*) and a const version (where the return value
   is const node*).
 EXAMPLES:
    const node *c;
    c->link( ) activates the const version of link
    list_search(c,... calls the const version of list_search
    node *p;
    p->link( ) activates the non-const version of link
    list_search(p,... calls the non-const version of list_search

 MEMBER FUNCTIONS for the node class:
   void set_data(const value_type& new_data)
     Postcondition: The node now contains the specified new data.

   void set_link(node* new_link)
     Postcondition: The node now contains the specified new link.

   value_type data( ) const
     Postcondition: The return value is the data from this node.

   const node* link( ) const <----- const version
   node* link( ) <----------------- non-const version
   See the note (above) about the const version and non-const versions:
     Postcondition: The return value is the link from this node.

 FUNCTIONS in the linked list toolkit:
   size_t list_length(const node* head_ptr)
     Precondition: head_ptr is the head pointer of a linked list.
     Postcondition: The value returned is the number of nodes in the linked
     list.

   void list_head_insert(node*& head_ptr, const node::value_type& entry)
     Precondition: head_ptr is the head pointer of a linked list.
     Postcondition: A new node containing the given entry has been added at
     the head of the linked list; head_ptr now points to the head of the new,
     longer linked list.

   void list_insert(node* previous_ptr, const node::value_type& entry)
     Precondition: previous_ptr points to a node in a linked list.
     Postcondition: A new node containing the given entry has been added
     after the node that previous_ptr points to.

   const node* list_search(const node* head_ptr, const node::value_type& target)
   node* list_search(node* head_ptr, const node::value_type& target)
   See the note (above) about the const version and non-const versions:
     Precondition: head_ptr is the head pointer of a linked list.
     Postcondition: The pointer returned points to the first node containing
     the specified target in its data member. If there is no such node, the
     nullptr pointer is returned.

   const node* list_locate(const node* head_ptr, size_t position)
   node* list_locate(node* head_ptr, size_t position)
   See the note (above) about the const version and non-const versions:
     Precondition: head_ptr is the head pointer of a linked list, and
     position > 0.
     Postcondition: The pointer returned points to the node at the specified
     position in the list. (The head node is position 1, the next node is
     position 2, and so on). If there is no such position, then the nullptr
     pointer is returned.

   void list_head_remove(node*& head_ptr)
     Precondition: head_ptr is the head pointer of a linked list, with at
     least one node.
     Postcondition: The head node has been removed and returned to the heap;
     head_ptr is now the head pointer of the new, shorter linked list.

   void list_remove(node* previous_ptr)
     Precondition: previous_ptr points to a node in a linked list, and this
     is not the tail node of the list.
     Postcondition: The node after previous_ptr has been removed from the
     linked list.

   void list_clear(node*& head_ptr)
     Precondition: head_ptr is the head pointer of a linked list.
     Postcondition: All nodes of the list have been returned to the heap,
     and the head_ptr is now nullptr.

   void list_copy(const node* source_ptr, node*& head_ptr, node*& tail_ptr)
     Precondition: source_ptr is the head pointer of a linked list.
     Postcondition: head_ptr and tail_ptr are the head and tail pointers for
     a new list that contains the same items as the list pointed to by
     source_ptr. The original list is unaltered.

  void list_piece(const node* start_ptr, const node* end_ptr,
                    node*& head_ptr, node*& tail_ptr)
    Precondition: start_ptr and end_ptr are pointers to nodes on the same
    linked list, with the start_ptr node at or before the end_ptr node
    Postcondition: head_ptr and tail_ptr are the head and tail pointers for a
    new list that contains the items from start_ptr up to but not including
    end_ptr.  The end_ptr may also be nullptr, in which case the new list
    contains elements from start_ptr to the end of the list.

 DYNAMIC MEMORY usage by the toolkit:
   If there is insufficient dynamic memory, then the following functions throw
   bad_alloc: the constructor, list_head_insert, list_insert, list_copy,
   list_piece.*/
