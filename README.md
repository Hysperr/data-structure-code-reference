# Data Structures & Abstract Data Types

The purpose of this repo is to provide a reference for students aiming to learn data structures. Documentation is provided. In some cases, multiple procedures to achieve the same result will be presented with a brief explanation for why we'd use each one. The code in this repository comes from my projects and assignments completed during my data structures course. All code is edited and updated. We used the book *Data Structures and Other Objects Using C++ (4th Edition)* by Michael Main and Walter Savitch. In some cases parts of their code is used as reference and built upon in examples. All of their original code is free to download at their website: https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/dscode.html

The number of data structures included in this repository is by no means an exhaustive list, but shall cover the basics from dynamic arrays and linked lists to stacks and trees. This is a WIP.
