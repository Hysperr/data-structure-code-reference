# Data Structures & Abstract Data Types

The purpose of this repo is to provide a reference for students aiming to learn data structures. Documentation is provided. In some cases, multiple procedures to achieve the same result will be presented with a brief explanation for why we'd use each one.

The number of data structures included in this repository is by no means an exhaustive list, but shall cover the basics from dynamic arrays and linked lists to stacks and trees. This is a WIP.
